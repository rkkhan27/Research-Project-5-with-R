## Exploring Relationships in Mexican Migration Project Data

This exercise was created by Dr. Jacqueline Mauro and is based on the following article:
Garip, Filiz. 2012. “Discovering Diverse Mechanisms of Migration: The Mexico–US Stream 1970–2000.”
Population and Development Review, Vol. 38, No. 3, pp. 393-433.

The data come from the Mexican Migration Project, a survey of Mexican migrants from 124 communities
located in major migrant-sending areas in 21 Mexican states. Each community was surveyed once between
1987 and 2008, during December and January, when migrants to the U.S. are most likely to visit their families
in Mexico. In each community, individuals (or proxy respondents for absent individuals) from about 200
randomly selected households were asked to provide demographic and economic information and to state the
time of their first and their most recent trip to the United States. The data included here on the proportion
of respondents’ income sent to Mexico in the form of remittances was simulated by the teaching assistants
of CMU’s Statistical Reasoning with R course (90-711).
